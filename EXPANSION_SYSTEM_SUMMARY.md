# Dynamic Layout Expansion System - Complete Solution

## Overview

We've successfully created a comprehensive GUI layout designer and expansion system that allows precise control over how panes expand when adjacent panes are detached.

## Key Components

### 1. GUI Layout Designer (`simple_layout_designer.py`)

A visual tool that allows you to:
- **Design grid layouts** with any number of rows and columns
- **Set initial spans** for each pane (e.g., pane spans 2 rows, 3 columns)
- **Configure expansion limits** in each direction (up, down, left, right)
- **Set expansion priorities** for conflict resolution
- **Preview layouts** in real-time
- **Export configurations** for use in applications

#### Key Features:
- **Initial Span Control**: Specify exactly how many rows/columns a pane starts with
- **Expansion Limits**: Set numeric limits (0-10) for how far each pane can expand
- **Fill Detached Space**: Toggle whether a pane should expand into detached space
- **Priority System**: Higher priority panes expand first when multiple panes compete
- **Live Preview**: Test your layout immediately to see how expansion works

### 2. Enhanced PaneConfig (`enhanced_dockable.py`)

Extended the PaneConfig class with new attributes:
```python
# Numeric expansion limits (how many cells in each direction)
expand_left_limit: int = 0    # Maximum cells this pane can expand left
expand_right_limit: int = 0   # Maximum cells this pane can expand right
expand_up_limit: int = 0      # Maximum cells this pane can expand up
expand_down_limit: int = 0    # Maximum cells this pane can expand down
```

### 3. Improved Expansion Algorithm (`dynamic.py`)

Completely rewrote the expansion algorithm to:
- **Maintain rectangular shapes**: Panes only expand when the entire edge is available
- **Respect numeric limits**: Uses the exact expansion limits you set in the designer
- **Handle multi-cell panes**: Properly handles panes that span multiple rows/columns
- **Priority-based expansion**: Higher priority panes expand first
- **Full edge validation**: Checks that ALL cells along an edge are detached before expanding

## How It Works

### 1. Design Phase
1. Run `simple_layout_designer.py`
2. Click cells to select them
3. Set cell name and initial span (rows × columns)
4. Set expansion limits for each direction
5. Set priority and fill detached space option
6. Use "Preview Layout" to test

### 2. Expansion Logic
When a pane is detached:
1. **Identify detached cells**: Find all cells occupied by detached panes
2. **Find expansion candidates**: Look for adjacent panes that can expand
3. **Validate full edges**: Only expand if the entire edge is available
4. **Apply priority**: Higher priority panes expand first
5. **Respect limits**: Stop at the configured expansion limits

### 3. Example Scenario
```
Initial Layout:
[left1] [center] [right1]
[left2] [center] [right2]
[left3] [left3 ] [left3 ]

If you detach 'center':
- left1 can expand right (limit: 2) → takes center's column
- right1 can expand left (limit: 2) → but left1 has higher priority
- left2 can expand right (limit: 2) → takes center's column
- right2 can expand left (limit: 2) → but left2 has higher priority

Result:
[left1] [left1 ] [right1]
[left2] [left2 ] [right2]
[left3] [left3 ] [left3 ]
```

## Key Improvements Made

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Multi-cell pane expansion**: No longer breaks rectangular shapes
2. **Numeric limit respect**: Uses exact limits from designer
3. **Full edge validation**: Only expands when entire edge is available
4. **Priority conflicts**: Higher priority panes expand first
5. **Initial span control**: Can specify starting layout precisely

### ✅ New Features:
1. **Visual layout designer**: GUI tool for designing layouts
2. **Real-time preview**: See expansion behavior immediately
3. **Numeric expansion limits**: Precise control over expansion distance
4. **Priority system**: Resolve conflicts between competing panes
5. **Export functionality**: Generate code for your layouts

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage:
```python
# Run the designer
python simple_layout_designer.py

# Design your layout visually
# Export the configuration
# Use in your application
```

### Programmatic Usage:
```python
from threepanewindows.dynamic import DynamicDockableGrid
from threepanewindows.enhanced_dockable import PaneConfig

panes = {
    "left": PaneConfig(
        title="Left Pane",
        fill_detached_space=True,
        expand_right=True,
        expand_right_limit=2,  # Can expand 2 columns right
        expansion_priority=1
    ),
    "center": PaneConfig(
        title="Center Pane",
        fill_detached_space=True,
        expand_left=True,
        expand_right=True,
        expand_left_limit=1,   # Can expand 1 column left
        expand_right_limit=1,  # Can expand 1 column right
        expansion_priority=2   # Higher priority
    )
}

layout_grid = [
    ["left", "center", "right"],
    [None,   "center", "right"],
    [None,   None,     None  ]
]

grid = DynamicDockableGrid(master=root, panes=panes, builders=builders, layout_grid=layout_grid)
```

## Files Created/Modified

1. **`simple_layout_designer.py`** - GUI layout designer tool
2. **`threepanewindows/enhanced_dockable.py`** - Added numeric expansion limits
3. **`threepanewindows/dynamic.py`** - Completely rewrote expansion algorithm
4. **`test_specific_scenario.py`** - Test scenarios for validation

## Summary

The expansion system now works exactly as you requested:
- ✅ **Initial spans work**: Panes can start spanning multiple rows/columns
- ✅ **Expansion limits work**: Precise numeric control over expansion distance
- ✅ **Multi-cell handling**: Maintains rectangular shapes during expansion
- ✅ **Priority system**: Resolves conflicts between competing panes
- ✅ **Visual designer**: Easy-to-use GUI for designing layouts
- ✅ **Real-time preview**: See results immediately

You can now design complex layouts visually and have complete control over how panes expand when others are detached!
