## 📊 Coverage Achievement

### Before Enhancement: 61.63%
### After Enhancement: **70.76%** ✅

| Module | Coverage | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `__init__.py` | 100% | ✅ |
| `cli.py` | 100% | ✅ |
| `themes.py` | 88% | ✅ |
| `_version.py` | 86% | ✅ |
| `fixed.py` | 84% | ✅ |
| `dockable.py` | 82% | ✅ |
| `examples.py` | 67% | ✅ |
| `enhanced_dockable.py` | 63% | ✅ |

## 🔧 Headless Compatibility Verified

✅ **Local Environment**: All tests pass  
✅ **Simulated CI Environment**: Tests skip gracefully  
✅ **Coverage Target**: 70.76% achieved  
✅ **No Display Dependencies**: Proper error handling

# Push to develop branch
git push origin develop
```

## 📋 Pre-Upload Verification

### ✅ Completed Checks:
- [x] Tests pass in local environment
- [x] Tests work with CI environment simulation
- [x] Coverage target of 70% is exceeded (70.76%)
- [x] No local-specific paths or configurations
- [x] Proper headless environment handling
- [x] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [x] Files are properly excluded from .gitignore

### 🔍 Final Test Commands:
```bash
# Verify coverage
python -m pytest --cov=threepanewindows --cov-fail-under=70 tests/

# Verify CI compatibility
python -m pytest -c pytest_ci.ini tests/test_enhanced_coverage.py

# Verify headless simulation
CI=true python -m pytest tests/test_enhanced_coverage.py
```
