# Static Files Directory
#
# This directory is required by Sphinx for static files (CSS, JS, images, etc.)
# Even if empty, the directory must exist to prevent Sphinx warnings.
#
# To add custom static files:
# 1. Place files in this directory
# 2. Reference them in your documentation using: _static/filename
# 3. They will be copied to the built documentation automatically
