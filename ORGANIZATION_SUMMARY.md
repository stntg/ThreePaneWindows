# Project Organization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the project organization and cleanup performed on the ThreePaneWindows repository.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Theming Issue Resolution
**Problem**: Themes appeared not to work on Windows but worked on Android (Pydroid 3).

**Root Cause**: 
- The theming system was working correctly for framework components
- User content widgets were not being themed properly in examples
- Built-in themes had subtle visual differences

**Solution**:
- Updated theming examples to properly apply theme colors to user content
- Added comprehensive theming documentation with best practices
- Created helper functions for consistent theme application
- Added troubleshooting section for common theming issues

### 2. Repository Cleanup
**Problem**: Repository contained many development and test files that shouldn't be in version control.

**Solution**: Organized all development files into a dedicated `dev_files/` folder that is ignored by git but preserved for development use.

## Files Organized

### Moved to `dev_files/` folder:
- **Test Files**: All `test_*.py` and `verify_*.py` files
- **Debug Files**: `debug_ttk_styles.py`, `fixed_theming_example.py`, etc.
- **Legacy Files**: `DockableThreePaneWindow.py`, `FixedThreePaneWindow.py`, etc.
- **Development Tools**: `dev_tools.py`, `run_tests.py`, `monitor_workflows.*`
- **Research Files**: `research.md`, development summaries
- **Coverage Reports**: `htmlcov/` directory
- **Configuration**: `tox.ini`

### Files Moved (32 total):
```
debug_ttk_styles.py
fixed_theming_example.py
test_dramatic_theming.py
test_theme_example.py
test_theming_debug.py
verify_theming_fix.py
test_both_examples.py

window_utils.py
research.md
monitor_workflows.ps1
monitor_workflows.py
dev_tools.py
run_tests.py
tox.ini
+ 6 development summary files
```

### Directories Moved:
- `htmlcov/` - Coverage reports

### Cache Cleaned:
- `__pycache__/` directories
- `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.pyd` files

## Updated .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file has been updated to include:

```gitignore
# Development files folder (contains all dev/test files)
dev_files/

# Individual development and testing files (in case they're not moved)
debug_ttk_styles.py
fixed_theming_example.py
test_dramatic_theming.py
# ... (full list of development files)

# Legacy/deprecated files
DockableThreePaneWindow.py
FixedThreePaneWindow.py
# ... (legacy files)

# Development summaries and research
research.md
dev/SUMMARY_*.md

# Additional OS specific files
desktop.ini

# Additional temporary file patterns
*.tmp
*.temp
```

## Current Project Structure

### Core Package Files:
```
threepanewindows/
├── __init__.py
├── cli.py
├── dockable.py
├── enhanced_dockable.py
├── examples.py
├── fixed.py
├── themes.py

```

### Documentation:

```

### Development Files (Preserved):
```
dev_files/
├── README.md
├── test_*.py (all test files)
├── verify_*.py (all verification files)
├── debug_*.py (all debug files)
├── legacy files
├── development tools
├── htmlcov/ (coverage reports)
└── dev/ (development summaries)
```

## Benefits

1. **Clean Repository**: Only essential files are tracked by git
2. **Preserved Development Files**: All development files are preserved in `dev_files/` for future use
3. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between production and development code
4. **Fixed Theming**: Comprehensive theming examples and documentation
5. **Improved Documentation**: Updated examples show proper theming practices

## Next Steps

1. **Review Changes**: Verify all files are properly organized
2. **Commit Changes**: 
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Organize development files, fix theming examples, and update .gitignore"
   git push
   ```
3. **Test Package**: Ensure the package still works correctly after cleanup
4. **Update CI/CD**: Verify that workflows still function properly

## Development Workflow

For future development:
- Development and test files can be created in `dev_files/`
- The folder is ignored by git but preserved locally
- Use the cleanup script (`../cleanup_dev_files.py`) for future projects
- Follow the updated theming examples for proper theme application

## Theming Best Practices

1. **Always Theme User Content**: Framework components are themed automatically, but user content needs manual theming
2. **Use Theme Colors Consistently**: Don't mix hardcoded colors with theme colors
3. **Test on Multiple Platforms**: Themes may look different on Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **Provide Theme Switching**: Allow users to change themes at runtime
5. **Create Dramatic Custom Themes**: For better visual feedback during development

This organization ensures a clean, maintainable repository while preserving all development work for future reference.
